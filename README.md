# Harshith's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This is a showcase of my skills and projects I have developed so far. Visitors can browse through my projects and visit the GitHub links to the repositories by clicking on them. They can also view my GitHub, Instagram, and LinkedIn profiles, as well as my resume. Additionally, I have included information on my achievements and education history.
